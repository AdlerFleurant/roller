This is my personal and experimental fork of Apache Roller. 
There are two experiments here:

1) shiro_not_spring: is a branch of Roller's trunk that has been modified to use 
Apache Shiro for security instead of Spring. Also, all Spring depdenencies have been removed.

2) jaxrs_not_struts: is a branch of Roller's trunk that has been modified to add
a REST API, powered by Apache CXF and Apache Shiro. Someday this REST API could power 
a new JavaScript based web interface for Roller.
