This is __Rollarcus__: my experimental fork of [Apache Roller](https://github.com/apache/roller).
So far, there are two experiments here:

1) [shiro_not_spring](https://github.com/snoopdave/rollarcus/tree/shiro_not_spring): is a
branch of Roller's trunk that has been modified to use Apache Shiro for security instead of Spring. 
Also, all Spring depdenencies have been removed.

2) [jaxrs_not_struts](https://github.com/snoopdave/rollarcus/tree/jaxrs_not_struts): is a branch of Roller's
trunk that has been modified to add a REST API, powered by Apache CXF and Apache Shiro. Someday this REST API
could power a new JavaScript based web interface for Roller.
